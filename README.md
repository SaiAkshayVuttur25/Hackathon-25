COLLEGE EVENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM :
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Event Awareness:
  This project is designed to keep students informed about upcoming college events by providing details such as dates, times, and locations. It also includes an integrated calendar to help students stay organized.

2. Voting System for Participation Insight:
  The platform features a voting system that allows students to express their interest in events. This helps event organizers estimate expected participation and plan logistics accordingly.

3. Automated Email Reminders:
  To enhance student engagement, the system sends automated email reminders to interested participants — both 24 hours and 1 hour before the event begins.
